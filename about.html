        <p>JotDown is the pen and paper list you know and love.
          Add items, cross them out, and clear them when you're done.
          There are no bells or whistles; just a clean interface to keep track of
          what's important.</p>

        <p>JotDown was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).</p>

        <h3>Lorenzo Bisceglia</h3>

        <p>I'm a third year computer science student at UBC and aspiring software engineer.
          My interests include graphic design, data science, food-related YouTube channels (shout-out
          to Bon App√©tit), and having my heart annually broken by the Vancouver Canucks.</p>

        <p>This is my first project using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Thanks for checking it out!</p>
