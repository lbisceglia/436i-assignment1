      <h2>The App</h2>

      <p>Bulletin is the pen and paper list you know and love, online.
        Add items, cross them out, and clear them when you're done.
        No bells or whistles; just a clean interface to keep track of
        what's important. Simple.</p>

      <h2>The Coder</h2>

      <p>Hi! I'm Lorenzo. I'm a third year computer science student at UBC and aspiring software engineer.
        My interests include graphic design, data science, food-related YouTube channels (shout-out
        to Bon App√©tit), and having my heart annually broken by the Vancouver Canucks.</p>

      <p>Thanks for checking out my app! Hit the links below if you'd like to give me any feedback
        or get in touch.</p>
